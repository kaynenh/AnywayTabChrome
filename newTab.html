    <p>People are often unreasonable, irrational, and self-centered. <strong>Forgive them anyway.</strong></p>
	<p>If you are kind, people may accuse you of selfish, ulterior motives. <strong>Be kind anyway.</strong></p>
	<p>If you are successful, you will win some unfaithful friends and some genuine enemies. <strong>Succeed anyway.</strong></p>
	<p>If you are honest and sincere people may deceive you. <strong>Be honest and sincere anyway.</strong></p>
	<p>What you spend years creating, others could destroy overnight. <strong>Create anyway.</strong></p>
	<p>If you find serenity and happiness, some may be jealous. <strong>Be happy anyway.</strong></p>
	<p>The good you do today, will often be forgotten. <strong>Do good anyway.</strong></p>
	<p>Give the best you have, and it will never be enough. <strong>Give your best anyway.</strong></p>
	<p>In the final analysis, it is between you and God. <strong>It was never between you and them anyway.</strong></p>
